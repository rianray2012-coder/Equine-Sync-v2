# EquineSync — Premium Equestrian Stable Management Platform

## Original Problem Statement
Premium all-in-one operating system for elite show barns, training facilities, lesson programs, rehab facilities, and luxury private equestrian operations. Combines horse care, stable operations, health tracking, rider progress, billing, communication, scheduling, staff management, and BI in a single mobile/tablet/desktop platform.

Brand: "Quiet luxury" — matte black, graphite, platinum, soft ivory, champagne accents. Cormorant Garamond (display) + Inter (body).

## User Choices (Feb 17 2026)
- Scope v1: Polished MVP first (core modules + rich demo data)
- Auth: JWT-based custom auth with role selection
- AI: Claude Sonnet 4.5 via Emergent LLM key
- Media: Object storage (deferred — using curated Unsplash photo URLs in v1)
- Design: Luxury matte black + champagne palette, Cormorant Garamond / Inter fonts

## Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI on 0.0.0.0:8001, supervisor-managed, MongoDB via MONGO_URL/DB_NAME from env
- **Auth**: JWT (HS256, 7-day expiry), bcrypt password hashing, role-based field on user
- **AI**: emergentintegrations.llm.chat → anthropic claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
- **Frontend**: React 19, React Router v7, Tailwind + custom equine palette, lucide-react icons
- **Routes**: 23 routes under `/api/*`; auto-seed on startup if `users` collection empty

## What's Been Implemented (Feb 17 2026)

### Backend (/app/backend/server.py)
- JWT auth: `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/me`
- CRUD endpoints: horses, owners, riders, medications, medication-logs, feed-tasks, vet-records, injuries, wellness, lessons, training, invoices, messages, service-requests, incidents
- Aggregates: `/api/dashboard/summary`, `/api/dashboard/barn-board` (Mongo-optimized with filters + projections)
- AI: `/api/ai/generate` (wellness_insight, training_summary, owner_update kinds)
- Seed: `/api/seed` (idempotent, no auth) — auto-runs on startup if empty
- Demo seeds: 5 demo users, 6 horses, 3 owners, 3 riders, 18 feed tasks (today), medications + logs, vet records, injuries, wellness, lessons, training, invoices, messages, service requests, incidents

### Frontend (/app/frontend/src/)
- AuthContext with JWT in `localStorage('equine_token')`, axios interceptor
- AppShell + Sidebar (23 nav items, lucide line-art icons, role-based user card)
- Login page with cinematic arena background and 5 demo accounts
- Dashboard: 5 stat cards + 6 widget cards (Feed, Lessons, Weather, Alerts, Wellness pulse)
- Today's Barn Board: tablet-optimised large cards for Feed, Medications, Lessons, Stall Rest, Incidents + Weather strip + quick-complete buttons
- Horses: roster grid with status pills + detail page with 9 tabs (Overview, Feed, Training, Health, Injuries, Medications, Wellness, Billing, Owner) + Claude-powered AI insights (Wellness / Training / Owner Update)
- Medications: today's doses + active prescriptions
- Health & Vet: vaccine/dental/Coggins/exam records + injury timeline with status pills
- Feed Room: morning/midday/evening grouping with sign-off
- Lessons: schedule + rider roster
- Training: daily ride log with ratings/homework
- Owner Portal: service request form + approval flow
- Billing: invoice list with pay action + revenue totals
- Messaging: send form with visibility controls + inbox
- Incidents: timeline view
- Owners, Riders, Settings: list/detail views
- Placeholders: Stall Rest, Turnout, Inventory, Shows, Documents, Maintenance, Staff, Reports

### Testing
- Backend: 20/20 pytest tests passing (auth, all CRUD, dashboard, AI generate)
- Frontend: Login + navigation verified e2e; Dashboard + Horses rendered correctly in screenshot
- Deployment health check: **PASS** ✅ (no blockers, no warnings)

## Deferred to Next Iteration (P1/P2)
- Object storage uploads for photos/documents (currently Unsplash placeholders)
- Stall Rest & Rehab dedicated workspace (hand-walking, icing, rehab log)
- Turnout & Pastures (herd compatibility, mud, rotation)
- Inventory with reorder alerts
- Shows & Competitions calendar with entries/stabling/packing
- Document vault with secure uploads
- Maintenance tickets (fences, gates, waterers, arenas)
- Staff management (workloads, shifts, certifications)
- Reports dashboard (profitability by horse/owner/service)
- QR codes for stalls/horses
- Real-time push notifications
- Mobile PWA install

## Next Tasks (priority order)
1. Object storage integration for photo/document uploads
2. Stall Rest & Rehab detailed workspace
3. Inventory module with low-stock alerts
4. Reports / BI dashboard with charts
5. Shows & Competitions full module
