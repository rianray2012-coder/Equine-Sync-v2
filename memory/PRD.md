# EquineSync — Premium Equestrian Stable Management Platform

## Original Problem Statement
Premium all-in-one operating system for elite show barns, training facilities, lesson programs, rehab facilities, and luxury private equestrian operations. Combines horse care, stable operations, health tracking, rider progress, billing, communication, scheduling, staff management, and BI in a single mobile/tablet/desktop platform.

Brand: "Quiet luxury" — matte black, graphite, platinum, soft ivory, champagne accents. Cormorant Garamond (display) + Inter (body).

## User Choices (Feb 17 2026)
- Scope v1: Polished MVP first (core modules + rich demo data)
- Auth: JWT-based custom auth with role selection
- AI: Claude Sonnet 4.5 via Emergent LLM key
- Media: Object storage (deferred — using curated Unsplash photo URLs in v1)
- Design: Luxury matte black + champagne palette, Cormorant Garamond / Inter fonts

## Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI on 0.0.0.0:8001, supervisor-managed, MongoDB via MONGO_URL/DB_NAME from env
- **Auth**: JWT (HS256, 7-day expiry), bcrypt password hashing, role-based field on user
- **AI**: emergentintegrations.llm.chat → anthropic claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
- **Frontend**: React 19, React Router v7, Tailwind + custom equine palette, lucide-react icons
- **Routes**: 23 routes under `/api/*`; auto-seed on startup if `users` collection empty

## What's Been Implemented (Feb 17 2026)

### Onboarding / Barn Setup Workflow (Feb 17–19 2026 — added)
- 10-step guided wizard at `/onboarding` with sticky stepper, autosave, resume-where-you-left-off, percent progress
- Steps: Barn Profile · Locations · Owners · Horses · Riders · Feed Templates · Inventory · Staff Invites · Recurring Schedules · Review & Launch
- CSV bulk import for **owners** and **horses**: drag-drop + paste + downloadable template + preview with duplicate detection + commit with server-side dedupe
- Backend models/endpoints: `/barn` (settings), `/locations`, `/feed-templates`, `/inventory` (with low_stock flag), `/recurring-schedules`, `/onboarding/{steps,progress,complete,reset,csv-preview,csv-commit,csv-template}`
- Role gating: only `admin` / `barn_manager` can edit barn-level settings or invite staff

### Magic-Link Invites + Email Layer (Feb 19 2026 — added)
- **Resend integration** (`mailer.py` abstraction) — **LIVE** with real API key as of Feb 19 2026.
- Sandbox handling: when Resend rejects non-owner recipients, mailer returns `status='sandbox'`, dev_accept_url surfaced in UI for manual share until domain is verified
- Branded HTML email templates: `_base.html` + `onboarding_invite.html` + `onboarding_nudge.html` (luxury aesthetic)
- Endpoints: `POST /invites`, `/invites/{id}/resend`, `/invites/{id}/revoke`, `GET /invites/verify`, `POST /invites/accept`
- Tokens: sha256-hashed at rest, single-use, 7-day TTL
- AcceptInvite page `/accept-invite?token=...` with password set, auto-launches onboarding for `admin`/`barn_manager`
- `APP_BASE_URL` env-driven with request-origin fallback

### Setup Health Reports + Nudge Automation (Feb 19 2026 — added)
- **`/reports` page** (admin/barn_manager only): 5 KPI cards (setups in progress, completed, completion rate, median time-to-launch, invite acceptance), 10-step funnel chart with status segmentation, invitation pipeline (total/accepted/pending/revoked/expired), low-acceptance amber coaching banner
- **Manual nudge trigger** `POST /admin/send-nudges` with configurable `min_days`/`cooldown_hours` (cooldown only persists on successful send), candidate list preview, "Send reminders" button
- **Daily automated scheduler** — asyncio task on backend startup runs every 24h after 6h warmup, controlled by `DISABLE_AUTO_NUDGES` env var
- Branded nudge email template with personalised "Pick up where you left off — X% done, next step: Y" copy
- Endpoints: `GET /reports/setup-health`, `GET /reports/nudge-candidates?min_days=N`, `POST /admin/send-nudges`
- Analytics events: `onboarding.nudge_sent`, `admin.nudges_run` (with auto/manual trigger metadata)
- Tests: 12/12 PASS (in addition to prior 75 passing tests)

### Polish + Analytics (Feb 19 2026)
- Native `<select>` replaced with **shadcn Select** in all onboarding form controls
- **Deep-merge** for `progress.data` (sibling keys in nested dicts preserved)
- **Tenant-level reset** endpoint `/admin/tenant-reset` (admin-only, requires confirm="RESET", scopes: onboarding | all_setup_data)
- **Settings page** exposes `Re-open setup` (per-user) and tenant-reset controls (admin only)
- **Dashboard checklist widget** — 10-tile detailed setup status grid with click-to-step navigation, replaces simple progress bar
- **Analytics events**: `POST /events` + `GET /events/onboarding-funnel` (admin) + frontend `track()` helper; events fire on step_completed, step_skipped, completed, invite_sent, invite_resent, invite_revoked, invite_accepted, csv_imported, tenant.reset

### Testing (Feb 19 2026)
- Backend: **20/20** invite/analytics/tenant-reset tests PASS (in addition to prior 35 passing onboarding+core tests)
- Frontend: 100% — all checklists, shadcn Select, accept-invite redirect, dev-link banner, tenant-reset UI verified by testing agent


### Backend (/app/backend/server.py)
- JWT auth: `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/me`
- CRUD endpoints: horses, owners, riders, medications, medication-logs, feed-tasks, vet-records, injuries, wellness, lessons, training, invoices, messages, service-requests, incidents
- Aggregates: `/api/dashboard/summary`, `/api/dashboard/barn-board` (Mongo-optimized with filters + projections)
- AI: `/api/ai/generate` (wellness_insight, training_summary, owner_update kinds)
- Seed: `/api/seed` (idempotent, no auth) — auto-runs on startup if empty
- Demo seeds: 5 demo users, 6 horses, 3 owners, 3 riders, 18 feed tasks (today), medications + logs, vet records, injuries, wellness, lessons, training, invoices, messages, service requests, incidents

### Frontend (/app/frontend/src/)
- AuthContext with JWT in `localStorage('equine_token')`, axios interceptor
- AppShell + Sidebar (23 nav items, lucide line-art icons, role-based user card)
- Login page with cinematic arena background and 5 demo accounts
- Dashboard: 5 stat cards + 6 widget cards (Feed, Lessons, Weather, Alerts, Wellness pulse)
- Today's Barn Board: tablet-optimised large cards for Feed, Medications, Lessons, Stall Rest, Incidents + Weather strip + quick-complete buttons
- Horses: roster grid with status pills + detail page with 9 tabs (Overview, Feed, Training, Health, Injuries, Medications, Wellness, Billing, Owner) + Claude-powered AI insights (Wellness / Training / Owner Update)
- Medications: today's doses + active prescriptions
- Health & Vet: vaccine/dental/Coggins/exam records + injury timeline with status pills
- Feed Room: morning/midday/evening grouping with sign-off
- Lessons: schedule + rider roster
- Training: daily ride log with ratings/homework
- Owner Portal: service request form + approval flow
- Billing: invoice list with pay action + revenue totals
- Messaging: send form with visibility controls + inbox
- Incidents: timeline view
- Owners, Riders, Settings: list/detail views
- Placeholders: Stall Rest, Turnout, Inventory, Shows, Documents, Maintenance, Staff, Reports

### Testing
- Backend: 20/20 pytest tests passing (auth, all CRUD, dashboard, AI generate)
- Frontend: Login + navigation verified e2e; Dashboard + Horses rendered correctly in screenshot
- Deployment health check: **PASS** ✅ (no blockers, no warnings)

## Deferred to Next Iteration (P1/P2)

## Next Tasks (priority order)
1. Object storage integration for photo/document uploads
